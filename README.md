## Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of various microeconomic factors using data spanning from 2013 to 2022. The data, sourced from the World Bank's World Development Indicators, includes 14 key economic indicators that provide insights into different aspects of global economies.

## Data Source
The dataset for this analysis was obtained from the World Bank's World Development Indicators database. It includes a wide range of economic indicators that are crucial for understanding different economic dynamics across various countries.

## Indicators
The project focuses on the following 14 indicators:

)Debt service on external debt, 
public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) (TDS, current US$),
Exports of goods and services (% of GDP),
Exports of goods and services (BoP, current US$),
Foreign direct investment, net outflows (% of GDP),
